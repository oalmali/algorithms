# algorithms
Golang implementations and benchmarking of common search and sort algorithms.

Benchmarking is done within builtin Benchmark function that comes with golang.org/pkg/testing/ package.

To be able to see results exec command:
go test -bench

Algorithms studied with khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/

Planning to use github.com/stretchr/testify to unit tests. 

Any contributions are appreciated.
